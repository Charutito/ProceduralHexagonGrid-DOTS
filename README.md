## ProceduralHexagonGrid-DOTS

The purpose of this project is to test the latest version of the DOTS package [0.50.0]. I made a hexagonal grid created from a Perlin Noise. The system is Hybrid so the user could change the values on runtime and see the grid change.

The parameters that edit the grid can be found in the GridManager element inside the scene:
